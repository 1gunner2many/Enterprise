I have chosen to start with a text file just to see the way the system works in the creation process. 
So I am doing a little pontificating while at the sane time watching to see how the word wrapping
functions. Perhaps the viewing alters how you see the text. That still remains to be seen. At some 
point I will have to either alter or clean-up yhis whole file so that it won't be confusing to people 
who want to log on and read about serious happenings.
