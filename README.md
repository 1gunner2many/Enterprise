AS my first repository it will coincide with the beginnings of a studio 

When I say the befinnings of a studio I am referring to the communications
and the workload portion of that studio. The large studios all have sets
where their actors, mediators, or newsmen can be seen recording their daily
weekly or scripted content. Someone has to do the heavy lifting, they have 
to bring together the various parts of the story being told.

This is a large job to accomplish and can be made easier by using the resources
that are available on the internet.
